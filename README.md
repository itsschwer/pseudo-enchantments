# pseudo-enchantments
[![Datapacks](https://img.shields.io/badge/See_more-datapacks-C7A978.svg)](https://github.com/itsschwer?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=mcfunction&sort=)

A datapack implementing pseudo-enchantments that take effect either when equipped or in the inventory.

## Intention

This datapack aims to add some quality-of-life 'enchantments' to vanilla surival gameplay.

These pseudo-enchantments are obtained in the form of Enchanted Scrolls (as opposed to Enchanted Books) and take effect when in the inventory — even without being applied to an item.

However, as using a pseudo-enchantment in its Enchanted Scroll form would occupy an inventory slot, players can also apply pseudo-enchantments onto certain other items *(e.g. armor)* through the ***[kitsune](https://github.com/itsschwer/kitsune)*** datapack.

## Guide
*This datapack was developed in 1.17 (`"pack_format": 7`) but should be compatible with versions using an equivalent or greater `pack_format`, barring major changes to commands/datapacks.*
